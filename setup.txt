--setting up a webpack--

prereqs:
- npm
- a repo that contains .gitignore

1. run `npm init -y` in your repo to generate package.json (-y generates default)
2. run `npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev` to install webpack to node_modules dir
(make sure node_modules/ is written in .gitignore since it gets big)
3. `mkdir src` and `mkdir dist`.
4. `touch src/index.js`, `touch dist/index.html`,  `touch webpack.config.js`
5. Link main.js in index.html since it's generated by the webpack
6. Copy paste the boilerplate code for webpack.config.js from webpack's Getting Started page
7. Run `npx webpack` to build the repo
(It'll automatically use the config.js it detects when you build, but you can run `npx webpack --config webpack.config.js` to build under a specific config.)
8. Add "build": "webpack" in scripts property of package.json. This lets you build via `npm run build`
